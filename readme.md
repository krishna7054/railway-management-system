# Railway Management System
This is a Node.js/Express.js based Railway Management System similar to the IRCTC, which allows users to check train availability, book seats, and view booking details. The system also provides role-based access where admins can add/update trains, and users can check train availability, book seats, and view booking details. The system handles race conditions for simultaneous bookings and uses PostgreSQL as the database.

## Features

### Admin Role:

- Add new trains to the system.
- Update train details (available seats, source, destination, etc.).

### User Role:

- Check train availability between source and destination for a specific date.
- Book seats for a train.
- View booking details.

### Race Condition Handling: 
Prevents double booking of seats when multiple users try to book at the same time.

### Token-based Authentication:
Users need to log in and get a token to perform any booking or train checking tasks.

### API Key Security:
Admin APIs are protected with an API key to restrict unauthorized access.

### Tech Stack
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Authentication: JSON Web Token (JWT) for user authentication, API key for admin access

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/railway-management-system.git
cd railway-management-system
```
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
3. Create a .env file in the root directory and configure your environment variables (example provided below and use .env.exmple for refrence):
```bash
PGHOST='PGHOST'
PGDATABASE='PGDATABASE'
PGUSER='PGUSER'
PGPASSWORD='PGPASSWORD'
ENDPOINT_ID='ENDPOINT_ID'
JWT_SECRET='your_jwt_secret'
API_KEY='your_api_key'
PORT=3000
```
#### Database Structure
4. Make this tables in your db:
- user
```bash
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,

  role VARCHAR(10) CHECK (role IN ('admin', 'user')) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
- train
```bash
CREATE TABLE trains (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    train_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    source VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    destination VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    total_seats INT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
- booking
```bash
CREATE TABLE bookings (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    train_id INT REFERENCES trains(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    seat_number SERIAL NOT NULL,
    booking_status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'confirmed', 
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
